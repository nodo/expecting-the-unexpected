Many microservice patterns require asynchronous communication to coordinate many moving pieces (e.g., IOT). The RabbitMQ commercial teams help enterprises with a wide variety of application requirements to build resilient asynchronous messaging systems - from messages integrating backend components to those sending urgent and critical data medical device data. In this talk, we will be talking about tiers of resiliency in the messages that are sent as well as how the combination of Spring + RabbitMQ helps you handle the expected unexpected. Weâ€™ll use a Spring app to demo RabbitMQ and show how to build resiliency.
